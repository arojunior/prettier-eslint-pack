## Dependencies:

We would like to thank contributors of below dependencies:

* [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint): _babel-eslint allows you to lint ALL valid Babel code with the fantastic ESLint_
* [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier): _Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier. This lets you use you favorite shareable config without letting its stylistic choices get in the way when using Prettier._
* [eslint-plugin-babel](https://github.com/babel/eslint-plugin-babel): _An eslint plugin companion to babel-eslint. babel-eslint does a great job at adapting eslint for use with Babel, but it can't change the built in rules to support experimental features. eslint-plugin-babel re-implements problematic rules so they do not give false positives or negatives._
* [eslint-plugin-flowtype](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype): _Flow type linting rules for ESLint_
* [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import): _This plugin intends to support linting of ES2015+ (ES6+) import/export syntax, and prevent issues with misspelling of file paths and import names. All the goodness that the ES2015+ static module syntax intends to provide, marked up in your editor_
* [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier): _React specific linting rules for ESLint_
* [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react): _React specific linting rules for ESLint_
* [flow-bin](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-bin): _Binary wrapper for Flow - A static type checker for JavaScript_
* [flow-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/happylynx/flow-webpack-plugin): _A webpack plugin allowing to call Flow type checker_
* [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky): _Husky can prevent bad commit, push and more üê∂ woof!_
* [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): _Run linters against staged git files and don't let üí© slip into your code base!_
